Xavier Student Center 


About the Project :
A platform for students where they can -
• Discuss the doubts
• Access study Material
• Upload Previous Year Questions
• Test themselves by taking Quiz
• Upload study Material


 Why this project is useful ?
Usually students look after social media platforms for a discussion with their 
friends on some topic or to share any kind of study material whether it is a book 
or previous year question papers. 

But such platforms are not made specifically for study purpose & hence they 
ain’t suitable if studies are concerned. 

Student should be exposed to an environment which is strictly based on 
academics thus eliminating any sort of distractions. 
Our attempt is to create Xavier as one of the platform which can help students 
with above mentioned features.
